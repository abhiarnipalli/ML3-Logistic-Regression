# Sustainability Analysis with Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a Logistic Regression Model in Python to analyze sustainability using the Global Data on Sustainability dataset. The project includes the creation of a custom one-vs-all logistic regression classifier with added functionality for different solvers. The classifier is trained by optimizing the solver and regularization parameters to achieve the best test performance.

## Skills Utilized
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Python
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning

## Introduction
Sustainability analysis is crucial for understanding and improving environmental, social, and economic outcomes. In this project, we use logistic regression to classify data from the Global Data on Sustainability dataset. The goal is to build an effective classifier that can accurately predict sustainability outcomes based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Global Data on Sustainability dataset, which includes a wide range of features related to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The data is used to train and evaluate the logistic regression model.

## Results
The results of the model's performance are documented in the `results/performance_comparison.csv` file. The accuracy and other performance metrics are visualized in the `results/model_accuracy_plots.png` file. The optimized logistic regression model demonstrates high accuracy and robustness, making it a valuable tool for sustainability analysis.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of logistic regression to sustainability analysis. By building a custom one-vs-all classifier and optimizing the solver and regularization parameters, we achieve a high-performing model. The insights gained from this project can inform policy and decision-making for sustainable development.
